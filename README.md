✨ Guess the word is a fun game where you input letters to guess the magic word! The word changes every time and you only get so many tries!

Here are some fun facts about this project:

📍 It was one of the final projects in the Skillcrush JavaScript fundamentals class

📍 The game uses an API call to fetch text from a file with over 800 of the most common English words.

📍 The game will then randomly select a word from the file, so each time they player visits, they'll get a new word to guess

📍 Just for fun I changed the background and the color of the words and placeholder bubbles
